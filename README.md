# Digimon Story Evolution Go (Backend)

## Introduction

This repository contains the backend for the Digimon Evolution Web App. It uses the Gin framework for Golang to provide a RESTful API that serves Digimon data to the frontend. This project is part of a learning exercise exploring new technologies and frameworks.

## Motivation

My love for Digimon Cyber Sleuth and Digimon Hacker's Memory games inspired me to create this project. While playing these games, I found a PDF that detailed the digivolution chart, complete with hyperlinks to each Digimon's image. This PDF was incredibly helpful, and I wanted to recreate that experience on the web while learning new technologies.

## Features

- **Gin Framework**: Implements the backend API with Golang's Gin framework.
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Manages Digimon data with PostgreSQL.
- **RESTful API**: Provides endpoints for retrieving and managing Digimon data.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Golang, Gin framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
