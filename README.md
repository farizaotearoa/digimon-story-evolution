# Digimon Story Evolution

## Introduction

This project is a learning exercise where I explore the Gin framework for Golang, Vue.js, and PostgreSQL. It aims to create a web version of the Digimon evolution chart from the games Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth and Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth Hacker's Memory. Inspired by a helpful PDF chart, this project brings that idea to life as a web application with interactive features.

## Motivation

My love for Digimon Cyber Sleuth and Digimon Hacker's Memory games inspired me to create this project. While playing these games, I found a PDF that detailed the digivolution chart, complete with hyperlinks to each Digimon's image. This PDF was incredibly helpful, and I wanted to recreate that experience on the web while learning new technologies.
